        "<strong>Generic Scan Bodies:</strong> Replace gray-painted scan bodies if the paint is worn out, as the shiny surface can distort scans.",
        "<strong>Tissue Span:</strong> Any tissue span over 20mm may cause distortion. For better accuracy, mark tissue areas with an indelible pencil.",
        "<strong>Scan Body Orientation:</strong> The flat side of the scan body should always face the buccal direction, ensuring the surface is free of distortions or holes.",
        "<strong>Materials:</strong> Titanium scan bodies are recommended for durability. Avoid plastic scan bodies (which can distort in the autoclave) and limit Peek scan bodies to two uses.",
        "<strong>Preparation:</strong> Ensure the scan body is wiped completely dry before scanning, as saliva can create a false layer. Always confirm the scan body is fully seated by taking an x-ray before scanning."
